      "text": "Over a course of 5 years, I have seen UFOs, observed bizarre behavior, and believe I may have directly been affected by it. In 2013, my friend and her boyfriend were driving us back to her house (in Hagerstown, MD at that time). I was looking out the window from the back seat when I saw a deep green light in the distance over the woods, in the sky, that moved slowly, horizontally, before pausing and dropping directly behind the trees.  In 2014, my friend and I were walking our coworker to her car outside of our restaurant job in Germantown (at that time). As we were talking to her before she ducked into her car, I noticed, again, a deep green light in the distance, in the direction of Father Hurley Blvd. It moved horizontally before pausing and dropping vertically. Later that Summer, we were driving on the back roads at night (in Boyds), when we saw large lights scattered within close proximity of each other in the sky. What freaked us out were the helicopters (3) and the plane-like drone that were flying towards them.  In 2016, I was walking home from a friends house mid-afternoon. I happened to glance up when I saw what looked like a large bundle of black balloons. What stood out to me was that they didn't appear to be moving, and I also couldn't make out if that's what it actually was (I can't see too well from afar). Shortly after, it broke up into several black pieces and sort of floated in the general direction I was walking in. I had taken my phone out and snapped a few photos right before it began to move, in which it had startled me. In me rushing home, my eyes kept on it when it eventually moved back together and kind of steadily and smoothly glided away.  To add to 2016; there was a night when these two figures in my neighborhood displayed very bizarre behavior that still has yet to sit well with me. I was on my porch some time after midnight when I heard shoes dragging against gravel from the end of my neighborhood. These two figures turned the corner at the end of the neighborhood and began to slowly walk in my general direction. They stopped at one point before one of them started to walk backwards at an angle, never turning to see what was behind him/her. The other person was walking towards a white van when they appeared to see me before taking a single step behind the van. I went inside at that point because of the sketchy behavior. We had a large, bay window in the living room/front of the house, so I peered behind the curtain. After a moment, I watched one of them make their way down my sidewalk, up my yard, to the window. They just stood there, never moved to look in or around, they just stood in front of me. I didn'! t make out a face as everything was dark within their hood. I eventually ran to get my brother and called the police. The next day, my uncle who lived up the block from us, his truck had been broken into and all of the papers within it tossed. Nothing was taken. That probably has nothing to do with the sightings, however directly after this happened, I started having dreams about things being on fire and tanks/planes falling from the sky. The dreams have not stopped yet, and are almost always consistent on a daily basis. I read that someone else who claimed to have seen UFO's had two men in hooded attire knock on his door late at night who frightened him. He claimed to have seen weird things in his head and had consistent dreams of wars. That's what made me want to bring this to light.  The last time I saw a UFO was in September of 2017 in Cancun, Mexico. It was at a resort and it seemed to be very far. It was pale looking and I think tic-tac like. I watched it move quickly back and forth but didn't know if I was actually seeing it. My brother's husband along with his brother claimed to then see it, which made me believe it was real. They are two of the biggest skeptics I know, so it solidified that for me.  I hope this sheds some light on your research, and I appreciate the work you all do in learning and expanding on the general knowledge of life as a whole.",

During New Years Eve when the neighbors were popping fireworks outside I took my daughters outside to see them while we waited for my wife to arrive from work.  While viewing the fireworks in the sky that were about 2 blocks away we noticed a triangle formation of lights that were flickering red and white and were almost above us.  The formation was located east/ southeast of the fireworks and were traveling at the same speed and seemed to hover for about 30-35 seconds.  We thought they were fireworks at first but then we noticed that they did not behave or explode with sparks like fireworks did and they lasted longer than any of the fireworks in the sky.

It was cigar shaped, but had a huge bulge in the middle (I used to call it a pregnant joint - if you are familiar with how that would look - skinny on the ends but bulging in the middle.

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you for responding.  The object seemed sphere or disc shaped.  The object was extremely far away, but we were able to see every color.  At one point a plane flew under the object and we were able to see how large it was in comparison.  It was at least two or three times the size of the aircraft.  The object ended up hovering for over an hour that we saw.  At one point the object dipped down and we noticed a smaller object below it that was similar.  When the larger object reached the smaller one, all of the sudden the smaller object disappeared.  We then noticed a large plane that flew under the large object flying North. The large object then suddenly disappeared. Please understand that I have never believed in UFO's nor do I believe in conspiracy theories.  This is a true account of what we have seen. I was not alone in seeing this object.  I do have a recording but my camera is so bad that it is difficult to see any of the colors that we saw on the recording.  Also, the object seemed much smaller in the recording than in real life.  If you would like for me to send you an attachment I will be more than happy to provide the documentation.

Myself and my mother her sister and daughter was watching tv waiting for the news to come on, at 2200 hrs watching wffa channel 8 news the reporter said, \"Folks, if you want to see something amazing go out side and look over the Dallas skyline\" which we did as well as most of the block. What we all saw was three objects looked like the size of a golf balls\u00a0from about 9 miles from Dallas texas looking east.  At about a 1000 to 1500 feet above Dallas.  These objects was stationery each emitting different colors like blue gold red green silver.  It was rather superb looking.  After just standing there for about a minute each one started to do bizzar monuvers\u00a0like one was zigzaging the other one was going up then down zipping from on side of the sky back and forth with the other two, at on point they formed a close circle and went spinning around at very fast speed. This lasted for about 3 min.  When the US Navy put a halt to the airshow\u00a0as they scrambled two F-8 crusaders which at that time was hot alert aircraft, which ment they was armed with the sidewinder missile, along with the 50.cal guns.  They flew from NAS Hensley field out side of Dallas on the southwest just about 6 miles away, it only took about 20 seconds from the time they took off to get\u00a0 over Dallas.  (I seen them as they left the air station only 3 miles away) never will forget how loud they was in full afterburner,  Just before they got on station, the three objects shot straight up in the night sky in a split second.  The F-8s made a few passes over Dallas before returning to there base. This left me with a impression that the ufos wanted to show the people what they could do, I know aircraft and it was nothing\u00a0 that any aircraft or helicopter could do. Not only did my family see this but was reported by was channel 8 news along with hundreds of people I will say on thing this report is not a hoax I seen other sightings as well but none as this one.",

It didn't sound like a jet or a helicopter, but it was a jet type sound. It moved slowly in a northeast direction and hovered directly over our pool for about 5 to 10 seconds and then continued to slowly continue. When it was above we could see what looked like two jet type engines at the back of the craft facing in a downward direction then they rotated back some and it continued moving slowly until it was out of site due to the roof of our house. We were both looking in amazement and didn't think to grab my phone to video until it had almost cleared the house and you really could see anything on the video since I tried to take the video so fast. We live near Space X, which is the general direction it came from and are about 35 minutes from Ft. Hood army base.  So we thought maybe it might be an experimental craft.
